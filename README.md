# High-School-Club-App
Club App I created for my high school club in 2021!

## Why I Created The App
It was the beginning of the pandemic and I was working virtually with my high school club and the Webmaster and Editor officer. During my time in this position,
I realized that many of the members of the club needed a hub to recieve relevant and up to date information. Thus, an app! As I was just a sophomore in high school,
I wasn't sure how to go about creating an app, and with what resources. So I did some researching and got to working. 


## How I Created The App

I found that I could create the app through the use of Google Slides. This was the perfect resource because it was free, and it was something that my club had access to.
So I got to designing and figuring out how I wanted the app to look like. What colors I wanted, what features it should have. I also considered how to present important information
that my members would need access to. 

Once I got all this brainstorming done, I got to work! I would create pages, and then test them, make sure that all the features worked and that people could properly use the app. 
I fondly remember sharing this app with friends before it was fully launched in the club, so that way they could help test and point out any kinks. Once the app was complete, I launched the app and shared it with the club. It proved to be incredibly successful and helpful for the members. 

## The App Now

I have graduated from high school and therefore do not maintain the operations and functionality of the app anymore. However, I did teach the officers after me how to maintain and update it. 

**What you see now, is what the current officers of the club have maintained, however, the design and general functions of the app are what I created!**
